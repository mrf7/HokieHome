2. Description of Hardware requirements: 
There are three hardware components that are necessary for this project. The first component is a Raspberry Pi 3. These can act as bluetooth beacons when running an implementation of AltBeacon. They also function as the internet-connected hardware controller for our LED's. Using a Raspberry pi as a light also requires at least two male to female jumper cables, one LED per light, and one resistor between 100 and 1,000 ohms. The second hardware spec is that there must be a separate device functioning as the server. This requires the ability to run Maven. Finally, the last hardware requirement is that there must be a bluetooth capable android device that has the implemented app installed.
